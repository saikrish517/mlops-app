## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a machine learning model using a modern MLOps pipeline. The workflow is designed to be scalable, reproducible, and maintainable, leveraging the power of cloud services and open-source tools.

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Infrastructure as Code: Using Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources.
- Experiment Tracking: Logging and tracking model experiments with MLflow.
- CI/CD Automation: Automating the deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- Containerization: Dockerizing applications for consistency across environments.
- Model Serving: Deploying the model as a REST API with FastAPI on GCP Cloud Run.
- Data Orchestration: Orchestrating data workflows with Prefect.
- Data Transformation: Utilizing dbt for data transformation in BigQuery.

## Results

The final deployed model is accessible through the API endpoint provided by GCP Cloud Run. Data is automatically fetched and ingested into the GCP BigQuery data warehouse on a daily schedule. Users can review the results of model predictions, along with accuracy and performance metrics, via the MLflow UI.

## Future Work

- Model Monitoring: Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Integrate tools like Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization.
- Scalability Improvements: Explore Kubernetes for managing large-scale deployments.
